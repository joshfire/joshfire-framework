/**
 * @fileOverview Base View class for the Joshfire Framework.
 *
 * The base view derives from Backbone's view to add:
 *
 * 1. a three-step rendering logic on top of Backbone's "render" logic. The
 * view exposes a "rendered" flag so that applications and derived classes may
 * tell when the the view is rendered and when it's not. See below for details.
 *
 * 2. "show"/"hide" functions to display or hide the view after rendering. The
 * view exposes a "hidden" flag used internally not to update the DOM uselessly
 * when the code calls show/hide more than once.
 *
 * 3. a "remove" function on top of Backbone's "remove" logic that sets a
 * "removed" flag, meant as a gatekeeper to detect and prevent actions attempted
 * on a view that should be up for garbage collection.
 *
 * 4. an images loader that extracts and fetches the images in the background
 * right after the view has been rendered and flags the view as loading in the
 * meantime.
 *
 * 5. a "load" event triggered when the view is done rendering (directly for
 * views that do not use the images loader)
 *
 * 6. a "scrollTop" function that attempts to scroll the view back to the top
 * of the page if possible.
 *
 * The typical life cycle of a view is:
 * - the view is created, initialization options help set its specificities
 * - the view gets rendered with a call to "render" or by its parent view
 * if the view happens to be the child of a container view.
 * - the view listens to events on models, collections, views, whatever and
 * updates itself as needed.
 * - the view gets removed from the DOM through a call to "remove", either
 * directly or by its parent view.
 * - that's it, the view should be garbage collected after that.
 *
 * The framework defines various views that derive from this base class,
 * in particular to add "container" logic for views that are to contain
 * other views.
 *
 * The rendering mechanism of a view is a three-step process:
 *
 * a) generate: Computes the HTML content to render as a string. This step
 * may be asynchronous, meaning it can be deported server-side or in a worker
 * as needed. The generate method either returns the inner HTML content to
 * put in the wrapping element associated with the view, or the outer HTML
 * content (wrapping element included), depending on the value of its first
 * parameter.
 *
 * b) setContent: Sets the HTML content prepared by generate as inner HTML
 * of the wrapping element.
 *
 * c) enhance: Completes the code with additional logic (e.g. event handlers)
 *
 * Unless absolutely needed, the "render" function should never have to be
 * overridden in derivated classes. Note that function sets the "rendered"
 * flag at the end of the rendering process.
 *
 * All views used in the framework must derive from this base class and must
 * respect those three steps (in particular, the HTML content must be prepared
 * as a string before it is applied to the underlying DOM element).
 *
 * Actually, all views used in the framework should rather derive from the
 * UIElement class (that class is a synonymous to View in the generic case but
 * is overridden in device-specific and capability-specific adapters)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: unless you have a good reason not to, you should always call
 * the "initialize" function of the parent's class from within the "initialize"
 * function of a derived class, using something such as:
 *  initialize: function (options) {
 *   View.prototype.initialize.call(this, options);
 *  }
 * ... replacing "View" with the appropriate parent's class name in your code.

   * has simply not yet been rendered.
   * - show/hide functions
   * - an images loader mechanism that renders a loading spinner while images
   * get loaded in the background. The "imageLoad" event is triggered whenever
   * a new image has been loaded. The "imagesLoad" event is triggered when all
   * images have been loaded.
   * - a "load" event triggered when the view is rendered and fully loaded,
   * unless the "customLoadEvent" option was set when the view was created.
